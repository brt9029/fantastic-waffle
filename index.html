        <p>
            I was born in New York City and spent my teen / young adulthood in Grand Rapids, MI. <br />
            When I was five years old, a family member of mine found difficulty completing a game named Bionic Commando for the NES. 
            They let me have a go and to their surprise, I completed not just the stage they were stuck on but also finished the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to the fun/interesting mechanics of this particular game, I became much more invested in gaming and pushed myself to learn more about every type of game I could get my hands on. <br />
            This lead to gaming becoming a passion of mine, along with crossword puzzles this is why I enjoy learning exactly why and how things work/don't work the way they do programmatically. 
            Today, I am working to become a Developer
