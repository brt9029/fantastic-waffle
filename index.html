            My name is Bryant. I was born in New York City and spent my teen / young adulthood in Grand Rapids, MI.
            For as long as I can remember gaming has always interested me, mechanics specifically. This caused me to push myself to learn as much as I could about every type of game I could get my hands on.
            Of course this lead to gaming becoming a passion of mine, along with crossword puzzles this is why I enjoy learning exactly why and how things work/don't work the way they do in a programmatic way. <br /><br />
            Today, I am working to become a Developer
